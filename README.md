# find-addends
An algorithm to find an arbitrary number of addends which sum to a desired number.
Inspired by the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1) puzzle.

The algorithm aspires to outperform a more direct "sum all combinations of X length"
approach which solves the same problem.

This repository also includes several resources to benchmark the results of the
algorithm using [Criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs).

Expect an article regarding the development in this repository on my (anthonyarusso)
personal website [The Russo Block](https://therussoblock.com).
